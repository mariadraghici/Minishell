The minishell functionalities are:

- cd command is implemented using getcwd to get the current
directory and save it and chdir to change the directory.
Beyond the basic functionality of cd (changing the directory),
the minishell can also go to the previous path (cd -) and
to the previous directory in ierarchy of the current one (cd ..).

- pwd command is implemented using fork and execvp. Firstly,
the redirections are made with dup2 for in/out/err and then
the execvp is called with the pwd command.

- exit/quit is implemented with a return of SHELL_EXIT code

- for the variable assignment implementation it is verified
if the value that is assigned to the variable includes
any other variables already defined and concatenate it with
the other values in the string. The variable is set using
setenv function. If a variable is used and undefined, the
value is "".

- for the external commands a fork is used and execvp.
Firstly, the redirections are made and then the command
is executed. The parent proccess waits for the child to
finish.

- run_in_parallel uses 2 forks for 2 commands to be
executed in parallel.

- run_on_pipe uses 2 forks and a pipe for redirecting
the output of first command as input for the second
command.
